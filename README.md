# steamR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josegallegos07/steamR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josegallegos07/steamR)

`steamR` provides an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) wrapper for [Steam's Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API).

The ultimate aim of `steamR` is to allow access to the all juicy data available on [Steam](http://steampowered.com) and to pave the way for some neat analyses.
